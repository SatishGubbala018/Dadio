        <h2>4. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful
          connections without gathering some basic information about you, such
          as basic profile details. We also collect information about your use
          of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third
          parties, like when you access our services through your social media
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          You hereby provide your consent to collect, process, and share your
          personal information with other users/members in order to provide the
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gather three types of information while you are availing our
          services:
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            <strong>Information submitted by you</strong>
            <p>
              You choose to give us certain information when using our services.

              </li>
              <li>

                may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the
                services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such
                collection. If you decline permission for us to collect your
                precise geolocation, while certain services or features might be

                We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar
                technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, SDKs) to recognize you
                and/or your device(s). Some web browsers (including Safari,
                Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track”
                (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want
                to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that
                responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can
                block that website from collecting certain information about the
                browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT
                signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses,
                including ours, do not currently respond to DNT signals.

          policies and procedures designed to protect your information. All of
          our service providers and partners agree to strict confidentiality
          obligations and data protection.

        <p>We may also share information:</p>

          that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device
          information, general demographics, general behavioral data, location
          in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed,
          non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. We may
          also share this information with third parties (notably, advertisers)
          to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on
          websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report
          on advertising you see. We may combine this information with
          additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed,
          non-human readable form collected from other sources.

        <p>
          While we are based in India and our app is currently meant and made
          live, for users in India, we may choose to extend our services beyond
          India in near future. We rely on highly reputed third parties/vendors/
          partners for hosting and storage of site and app data including the
          user data/ information/ content. Such third parties/vendors/ partners
          have global existence and have their servers at several locations
          across the globe. Therefore, your information may be retained,
          processed and transferred to locations across the globe by such third
          parties/ vendors/ partners. All of our service providers and partners
          agree to abide by strict confidentiality obligations and data

            by the app by uninstalling it using the standard un-installation

        <p>

        <h2>10. Date Security, Integrity &amp; Retention</h2>
        <p>
          The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are
          extremely important to us. We have implemented technical,
          administrative, and physical security measures that are designed to
          protect user information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use,
          and modification. We regularly review our security procedures to
          consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware that,
          despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or
          impenetrable. We will retain your personal information for the length
          of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy
          unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>11. How Long We Retain Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for
          legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. If
          you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and
          your profile will stop being visible to other members. After your
          account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid
          out below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a
            safety retention window of three months following account closure,
            or one year following an account ban. During this period, we keep
            your information that in the event might be necessary to investigate
            unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during
            this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as
            well as that of potential third-party victims.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete majority of your
            data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as
            laid out below:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention
              obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for ten years
              to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card
              information for the duration the user may challenge the
              transaction and “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with
              legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of
              consent(s) members give us for five years to evidence our
              compliance with applicable law.
            </li>
            <li>
              We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate
              interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as
              well as imprecise location of download/purchase for five years to
              support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable
              us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim; information on the
              existence of past accounts and subscriptions, which we delete
              three years after the closure of your last account to ensure
              proper and accurate financial forecasting and reporting; profile
              data for three years in anticipation of potential litigation, for
              the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and data
              necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new
              account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital
              interests of our members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate
              interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim
              or dispute requiring us to keep information [in particular if we
              receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve
              data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with
              our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as
              part of legal proceedings].
