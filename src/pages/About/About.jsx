            <p>
              Dadio is the world's first dating app with audio profiles. Every
              person has an audio introduction, so you can not only see a person
              but also hear their voice. You can now chat with everyone for
              free! You can see all the persons nearby with their distance,
              name, and gender. If you like someone, simply click on the heart
              button or send a text messageâ€”it's all free. If you want to chat
              on audio, you can simply call the person. However, audio calls are
              a paid feature. Simply add as little as Rs 10 to start enjoying
              the audio call / audio chat feature.
            </p>

            <p>
              In other dating apps, you often have to become a premium member
              before you can send any message to other users. Dadio is the first
              FREE dating app, where you can send unlimited free text messages
              to anyone without paying any money.
            </p>

            <p>
              On Dadio, you can search profiles with images, name, gender,
              distance, etc., and can simply send them a free text message to
              start the conversation.
